# Vulnerability Prediction

A web-based application that predicts the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited using machine learning. The project includes a Flask web interface for user input and result display.

## Features

- **CVSS Score**: Common Vulnerability Scoring System score.
- **Exploitability Subscore**: Score indicating how easily the vulnerability can be exploited.
- **Impact Subscore**: Score indicating the potential impact of the vulnerability.
- **Access Vector**: Indicates the range at which the vulnerability can be exploited (network, adjacent network, local).
- **Authentication**: Indicates the number of times an attacker must authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Confidentiality Impact**: Indicates the impact on confidentiality if the vulnerability is exploited.
- **Integrity Impact**: Indicates the impact on integrity if the vulnerability is exploited.
- **Availability Impact**: Indicates the impact on availability if the vulnerability is exploited.
- **Vendor**: The vendor of the affected product.
- **Product**: The affected product.
- **Vulnerability Type**: Type of the vulnerability (e.g., SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, Information Disclosure).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vulnerability-prediction.git
    cd vulnerability-prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask app:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. Fill out the form with the required information and click "Predict" to get the prediction result.
